# Detailed Pin Locations

An interactive map limited to the USA and Canada, built to display city-level data through intuitive visual markers and detailed modals. The map is customized for clarity, user engagement, and ease of navigation.

## Features

- **Pinned Map Locations**: Key cities are marked with pins directly on the map, allowing users to quickly identify specific locations across the USA and Canada.
- **Tooltip on Hover**: When a user hovers over a map pin, a tooltip appears showing detailed information about that location. This provides instant, glanceable data without requiring clicks.
- **Sample Legends**: Visual legends are included to help users interpret the meaning of various map markers or categories, enhancing usability and comprehension.
- **City List with Modal Details**: A separate list of all pinned cities is provided below the legends. Clicking on a city opens a modal with more comprehensive details about that location, such as demographic or business data.
- **Custom Tooltip Positioning**: The default tooltip behavior in datamaps.none.js has been manually adjusted to improve positioning accuracy and prevent visual overlap with pins or other elements.

## Technologies Used

- **Datamaps.js**: For rendering and interacting with the geographic visualization.
- **JavaScript**: To manage interactivity such as tooltips, modals, and dynamic data.
- **HTML/CSS**: For layout and visual styling.
- **Modified datamaps.none.js**: Customized specifically for improved tooltip behavior.
